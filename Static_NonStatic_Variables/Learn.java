//There are three ways of using class and objects
//1) Via creating the object
//2) Statically
//3) Inheritansce

/* In a nutshell:

Inheritance: "Parent-Child Relationship" (reusing code from a parent class).

Static Method: "Class-Level Method" (shared, doesnâ€™t need an object).

Non-Static Method: "Instance-Level Method" (requires an object, works on its state).
